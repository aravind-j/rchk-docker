# rchk-docker #

## Overview ##

This repository contains Dockerfiles for Docker containers to run [Tomas Kalibera's rchk tools](https://github.com/kalibera/rchk).

## Getting Started ##

You need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/installation/). Then you can start a container with `docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-base` (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for the `docker run` command options).

## Use cases ##

The intended use-case is to allow package maintainers to run the tools on their R packages.
